#+title: sly-overlay

This library is an extension for [[https://github.com/joaotavora/sly][Sly]] that enables the overlay of Common Lisp
evaluation results directly into the buffer in the spirit of [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider][CIDER]] (Clojure) and
[[https://github.com/xiongtx/eros][Eros]] (Emacs Lisp).

The primary function to call is ~sly-overlay-eval-defun~, which can be bound to
whatever is usually bound to ~sly-eval-defun~.

There is otherwise no other special setup necessary for using the library.

* Installation

~sly-overlay~ is available on MELPA.
